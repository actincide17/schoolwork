            <p>Mix the ground coffee with the water in a large container.
             Cover and allow to sit at room temperature for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours. </p>
            <p>Line a fine mesh strainer with cheesecloth and set over a pitcher or other container.
             Pour the coffee/water mixture through the strainer, allowing all the liquid to run through.
             Discard the grounds. </p>
            <p>Place the coffee liquid in the fridge and allow to cool. Use as needed.</p>
            <p>To make iced coffee, pack a glass full of ice cubes. Fill the glass 2/3 full with coffee liquid.
            Add a healthy splash of half-and-half. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk (you can use plain sugar instead) and stir to combine. Taste and adjust half-and-half and/or sweetened condensed milk as needed.</p>
